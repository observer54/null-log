  <h1>🌀 Nice to Meet You. I’m Mr. Null.</h1>

  <p>🎯 Congratulations—you’ve somehow stumbled upon this tiny speck of a blog in the vast universe of the internet, with zero promotion or reach. That alone deserves applause.</p>

  <p>👋 Since you've made it here, let me start with a brief self-introduction.</p>

  <p>🙋‍♂️ I go by <strong>Mr. Null</strong>. I’m a middle-aged man, still working and fully operational.</p>

  <p>🍽️ I love good food. The other night, I dreamed of eating an incredible mackerel sandwich.<br>
  Since hopping on a flight to Turkey wasn’t exactly practical, I settled for a DIY version: a baguette, some tomato and lettuce, and canned mackerel from the supermarket. Not bad at all.</p>

  <p>🎵 I’m also a big music lover—open to pretty much any genre. Lately, I’ve been into Tamil pop music, especially the works of <strong>A.R. Rahman</strong>. His melodies are beautifully cinematic. I imagine they’d be even more enjoyable if I understood the language.</p>

  <p>⚙️ That said, I’ve been noticing something lately.<br>
  When I push myself hard at work—like I used to in my younger days—it now takes more than just one night to recover. Sometimes it stretches into the next day… or even longer.</p>

  <p>🐾 Even during walks with my dog, I occasionally trip over small steps or uneven pavement.<br>
  Luckily, I’m built pretty solidly, so I haven’t sustained any major injuries.<br>
  Still, I’ve started thinking:<br>
  <em>"Maybe it’s time for a system reboot or some internal updates."</em></p>

  <p>🧠 In this age where living to 100 isn’t so rare, I realized that just going with the flow might eventually lead to some inconvenient limitations. So about a month ago, I decided to <strong>revisit the ancient ritual of weight loss.</strong></p>

  <p>⚖️ Currently, I weigh <strong>0.15 tons (330 lbs).</strong><br>
  I’ve been heavier in the past, but let’s be honest—it’s not exactly featherlight.</p>

  <p>📵 I’m not here to launch some social media “weight loss challenge” or chase online fame.<br>
  I honestly couldn’t care less about that.</p>

  <p>🔁 The truth is, over the course of my life, I’ve probably lost and regained <strong>over 500 kilograms</strong> in total.<br>
  I’ve been through countless cycles of gaining and losing.<br>
  Let’s just say I’m a <strong>self-proclaimed professional dieter</strong> (lol).</p>

  <p>📚 I know a fair bit about nutrition and weight control.<br>
  If needed, I can plan out both bulking and cutting phases with some degree of precision.<br>
  I even have my own original methods—though they’re so plain and repetitive that I always thought no one would find them interesting.</p>

  <p>💡 But now that I’m older, I’ve started to think:<br>
  <strong>Maybe there’s value in sharing this.</strong></p>

  <p>🌍 I doubt many people out there are exactly 0.15 tons like me, but there are surely plenty who feel overwhelmed by how much weight they’ve gained and wonder if they can turn things around.</p>

  <p>🧭 Imagine knowing there’s someone, somewhere in the world, sticking to a structured weight-loss routine.<br>
  Someone consistently tracking and sharing their progress each day—quietly, without drama.</p>

  <p>💭 Picture that person for a moment.<br>
  Wouldn’t it be a small encouragement to know they exist?</p>

  <p>📓 That’s the emotion that led me to create this blog.<br>
  This time, I’ve decided to document my <strong>cutting phase</strong> openly and honestly—<br>
  No hype, no filters, just raw, unadorned data.</p>

  <p>🗓️ I won’t be posting every single day.<br>
  I’ll write when I feel like it, when I have something to say.</p>

  <p>🙏 If you’ve found your way here, I believe there’s a reason for it.<br>
  And I want to say thank you—for your presence.</p>

  <p>🌱 May your dreams and hopes come true, little by little, one day at a time.<br>
  And if I can play even a microscopic part in supporting that journey…<br>
  then all of this is already worth it.</p>
