  <h1>Welcome to the Blubber Blog</h1>
  <p><em>by Mr.Null</em></p>

  <p>
    Who in the world wants to read someone else’s diet log?<br>
    Well, if you’re wondering that... try doing it!
  </p>
  <p>
    I chose this place because Octocat is adorable.

  <p>
    This blog is the mumbling of a walrus who finally decided to start dieting.<br>
    I ramble about small things from today, shopping finds, and random thoughts. <br>
    In short — it’s a mess. Please bear with me.
